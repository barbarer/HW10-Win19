# HW10-Win19

Contains the instructions, a sqlite database, and starter Python code.

Read the instructions in HW 10 Directions.pdf

Open the tweet_data.sqlite database in DB Browser for SQLite to understand the data.  Be sure to close this before you run the Python code to read from the database.

Modify the code in HW10.py.  Execute the code in the same directory as the database file.  Make sure that you pass all unittests. Then comment out the unittests and run the code to create the visualization(s).  Save each visualization to a file (click on the save icon).

Do at least 3 git commits.  Push the changed files to your github repository.  Upload a link to your github repository on Cavnas and upload the visualization file(s).
